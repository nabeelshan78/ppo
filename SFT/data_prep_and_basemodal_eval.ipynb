    "# Data Preparation and Base Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to prepare the `Dahoas/synthetic-instruct-gptj-pairwise` dataset for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and to evaluate the performance of the base `gpt2` model before any fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Steps\n",
    "1.  **Load Data**: Loaded the raw dataset from Hugging Face.\n",
    "2.  **Format for SFT**: Processed the dataset by combining the `prompt` and `chosen` response into a more explicit `prompt` and `completion` format suitable for the `SFTTrainer`.\n",
    "3.  **Base Model Inference**: Tested the pre-trained `gpt2` (124M) model on a sample prompt to establish a baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outcome & Next Steps\n",
    "The dataset is now correctly formatted. The base `gpt2` model's response to the test prompt was irrelevant, demonstrating a clear **relevance failure** and confirming the need for fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to use this processed data in to perform Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) using LoRA to align the model to our instruction-following task."
