        "Hip-hop music is a style of popular music which originated in the United States in the late 1970s. It is rooted in African-American culture and is closely related to other elements of hip-hop culture such as rap, break dancing, and graffiti. The earliest predecessor of hip-hop is the West African music genre known as Kool Herc, which was developed in the early 1970s by Jamaican-born musician Clive Campbell. The sound was characterized by rhythmic speaking which emphasised the syncopation of beats and samples, pairing them with MCing and DJing. By the mid-1970s, much of what would come to be labeled hip-hop had been developed by a broad array of African-American performers from cities such as the Bronx and Brooklyn, New York. It wasn't until 1979 that the term \"hip-hop\" was officially used to describe this new emerging subculture. From the 1980s onwards, hip-hop has grown significantly, both in terms of regional popularity and global influence, becoming one of the most popular music genres in the world today.",

        "Stocks are investments in a company that tend to provide higher returns than other investments such as bonds. When you invest in stocks, you purchase shares of a company and you become a shareholder with a claim to a fraction of the company\u2019s profits or assets. Stocks tend to be a riskier investment than bonds because the price of a stock can go up or down depending on a number of factors. Investing in stocks should be approached carefully and with knowledge of how various factors can affect stock prices. \n\n2 It is also important to understand the different types of investments and how they work. For example, mutual funds are collections of stocks, bonds, or other securities bought and sold together, giving you a diversified portfolio.
